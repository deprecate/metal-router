# Basic

Basic example of routing link URLs to Metal.js components through soy.

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS >= [v0.12.0](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.0/), if you don't have it yet.

2. Build the code:

  ```
  npm run build:demo
  ```

3. Run some local web server on the root of the project and open `http://localhost:[PORT]/demos/basic-soy/index.html` on the browser. Note that metal-router will not work on `file://`.
